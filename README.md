Working:-
This project behaves like an online shopping platform. There is a catalogue of products available. Users can view the features of products before purchasing them. They can also select the quantity of the product they wish to buy. Users can add products to their shopping carts and view the carts. They can also delete products from their carts. When they are done purchasing, users can request for the final bills. They will then have to fill in some final details related to shipping and the mode of payment. The order is now confirmed and the estimated delivery time will be updated.
